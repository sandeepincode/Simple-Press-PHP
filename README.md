<b>YOBO : "You Only Blog Once"</b><br><br>
This was a group project which was completed by myself and three others. Our unique concept was to design a CMS for bloggers. The system would have a front end and back end. The blogger would login and interact with the back end, which had a zero code interface and simply used the WYSIWYG Editor and Fancy Box Viewer. <br>

The back end allows the admin/blogger to publish articles to a simple front end which uses Bootstrap for the interface styling. The back end allows multiple bloggers on the same account and can have multiple articles "published" or saved as drafts as "unpublished".<br><br>

<b>Security Issues Known :skull: :</b>
* The password hashing uses MD5, which for obvious reasons isn't that great. Althought the system/database doesn't store any serious data this area could be improved.
* In the back end the text editor used can allow the blogger to edit in HTML or TEXT. Therefore security issues lie with script injection and iFrames. However, it is their own blog they are damaging lol.

<b>FrameWorks/Tools Used:</b>
* PHPMailer
* WYSIWYG Editor
* Fancy Box Viewer
* Bootstrap
